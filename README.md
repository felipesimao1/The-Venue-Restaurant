# The Venue Restaurant

"The Venue Restaurant" is a system where users can book a table for dinner. They also have the ability to update or cancel their reservations.
In this project I used the knowledge I acquired about creating, updating, reading and deleting (CRUD) information using the Python language and the Django framework.
