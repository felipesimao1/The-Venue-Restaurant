# The Venue Restaurant

"The Venue Restaurant" is a system where users can book a table for dinner. They also can update or cancel their reservations.
In this project I used the knowledge I acquired about creating, updating, reading, and deleting (CRUD) information using the Python language and the Django framework.


## Prerequisites

On the homepage, we can see some buttons to navigate through the site (home, about us, menu, and contact)
We can also see the login buttons, if you have already registered, and sign up if this is your first access.

## Login Page:

The login page has space for the user to log in using their username and password.

On the registration page, we can see four spaces (username, email, password, and password confirmation.

If in the middle of the process, the person remembers that they already have an account, the user can also go to the login page using the button below or in the nav bar above.

4. Mobile Navbar:

Soon after, the user's name appears in the nav bar welcoming and alerting the user that he or she is already logged in. By clicking on your name or on "Make Reservation" you will be directed to the page where you can make your first reservation.

In the reservation editing area, the user will be informed of the current status of their reservation and will be asked for new information.
